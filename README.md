# Digital-Images-For-Dummies
Mychal Masterson


Welcome to the tutorial that will help you understand digital images easily. Although digital images sound like only professionals can understand them, their basic defining characteristics are actually simple for anyone to learn. We'll focus on the major differences of [Bitmap](https://github.com/mychalmasterson/Final-Project/blob/master/Bitmap.md) (aka Raster) and [Vector](https://github.com/mychalmasterson/Final-Project/blob/master/Vector.md) images.

This tutorial will be particularly helpful for a hobby photographer who wants know which image type to use that will best serve a photo's mission. Photos hardly ever go unedited anymore, so knowing which image type to use before editing an image is key to optimizing image quality.
