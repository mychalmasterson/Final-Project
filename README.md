# Digital-Images-For-Dummies
By Mychal Masterson


Welcome to the tutorial that will help you understand digital images easily. Although digital images sound like only professionals can understand them, their basic defining characteristics are actually simple for anyone to learn. We'll focus on the major differences of [Bitmap](https://github.com/mychalmasterson/Final-Project/blob/master/Bitmap.md) (aka Raster) and [Vector](https://github.com/mychalmasterson/Final-Project/blob/master/Vector.md) images.

This tutorial will be particularly helpful for a promoter of any sorts who wants know which image type to use that will best serve an image's mission. Images hardly ever go unedited anymore, so knowing which image type to use before editing is key to optimizing image quality for whatever an image's purpose, be it anywhere from a simple logo to a realistic portrait.

Can you guess which image is likely vector and which is likely bitmap?
