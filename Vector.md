## 3. Vector Images ##


Vector images are like a mathematical formula. Instead of storing the image as tons of pixels, vector images break an image down to very simple lines, points, and shapes. So, at any size, the image maintains its quality because the forumla doesn't change.

Graphic designs such as logos or signs are best saved as vector images. These types of images may want to be small enough to be included in a letter head, and at the same time big enough to be recognizable on the side of a company vehicle, or above the doors to a building. For an image that will need to fit any size according to scale, vector images are a far better choice than bitmap images.

As you can see, the zoom in on the vector image looks exactly how it should, thanks to the formula that the image is stored as. 

The 4 most common vector image file types are: 
* .pdf
* .svg
* .eps
* .ai

These file sizes are commonly smaller than bitmap image file sizes. With bitmap images, we know that more pixels translates to a higher image quality. But more pixels also translates to a larger file sizes, whereas the formula that composes a vector image is the same, and it usually takes up less space than its bitmap counterpart.

So that's it! Now you have a basic understanding of the differences between bitmap and vector images. Now you know when to use which image type in order to avoid any pitfalls that could come with poor image quality.
