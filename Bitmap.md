##Bitmap (Raster) Images##

Bitmap images depend on pixels. A pixel is a tiny box that emits one color. Similar to how atoms and molecules are tiny pieces that make up an object, pixels are tiny boxes that come make up an image. But more molecules translates to a bigger object. That isn't the case with pixels. With any image, the physical size of the image is always the same. What changes is the size of the boxes making up that image. The smaller the boxes, the finer the image. So, more pixels translates to a higher image quality. 

Highly detailed images such as photos or realistic paintings are best saved as bitmap images, as long as there are plenty of pixels wherever the image will go. This isn't typically a problem to worry about today, all of our modern devices are is loaded with plenty of pixels. But if an bitmap image is zoomed in far enough, those pixels become bigger and bigger, and the image quality decreases rapidly.


This kind of image distortion probably looks familiar. It's exactly what happens when you zoom too far in on a bitmap image. Those boxes that you see are pixels.

You'll find that bitmap images are shared more often than vector images. The 4 most common file types are: .jpg , .png , .gif , and .tif . These file types are sent between people far more often than the Vector file types.
