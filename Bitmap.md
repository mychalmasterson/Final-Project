Bitmap images depend on pixels. A simplified definition of a pixel is a tiny box that emits one color. Similar to how atoms and molecules are tiny pieces that make an object, pixels are tiny boxes that come together to form an image.

Highly detailed images such as photos or realistic paintings are best saved as bitmap images, as long as there are plenty of pixels.

Bitmap images are shared more often than vector images. The 4 most common file types are: .jpg , .png , .gif , and .tif .
